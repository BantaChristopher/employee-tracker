  ## Installation

  Youre going to go to the GitHub repo for the project and copy the SSH git address. Once done, head to your console of choice and enter the folder you want the project to be installed in. After that type git clone <repo name> and it will install the application to your destination. Open the file in VSCode and open the integrated terminal. Type ```nmp i``` to install all required packages, you will also need to have MySql installed. You will run mysql in the integrated console with ```mysql -u root -p``` and then enter your password. From there you can ```SOURCE db/schema.sql``` and ```SOURCE db/seed.sql``` to get the database started. Once all that is complete quit mysql and run ```node index.js``` to launch the application.

  ## Usage

  Click on the desired result from the list the application gives you and follow the on screen instructions!
